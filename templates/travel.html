    <h3>Flying to Argentina</h3>
    While there are flights directly to Rosario, they tend to be expensive. We recommend flying to Ezeiza Airport (EZE) in Buenos Aires.</p>

    <p>Flights range in price depending on the destination. From the east coast, we've seen flights as low as $800 and from San Francisco, $1,000. Expect anything from $800 - $1,300. Our favorite airline to fly is <a href="http://www.lan.com/en_us/sitio_personas/index.html">LAN</a>, but Delta and American Airlines are great options too.</p>

    <p>We usually book via <a href="https://kayak.com">Kayak</a> or <a href="http://hipmunk.com">Hipmunk</a>, but we do have a local travel agent you can contact directly for help booking flights, tours, hotels, etc. You can email her at:</p>

        <p>Yanina Mana<br />

    <h3>Traveling to Rosario from Buenos Aires</h3>

    <p>If you are traveling directly to Rosario from EZE, we recommend booking a shuttle in advance using <a href="http://mtlrosario.com.ar/consultas">Manuel Tienda León</a>. They will pick you up near baggage claim and drop you off directly at your hotel. The drive is about four hours and cost is $50.</a></p>

    <p>If you plan to explore Buenos Aires before the wedding, Manuel Tienda León will also pick you up from your hotel in Buenos Aires and drop you off at the hotel in Rosario. Another option is to take a bus from one of the main bus stations in Buenos Aires. Check with your hotel for the station and bus to take.</p>

    <h3>Hotel in Rosario</h3>
    <p> The official wedding hotel is the <a href="http://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/us/en/rosario/rsrex/hoteldetail">Holiday Inn Express Rosario</a>. Located just a few blocks from the river, it's in a great part of town and is clean, modern and safe.</p>
    
    <p> Rooms are $80/night for a king or two queens, and we are working out a special rate to bring that down even further. Check back in a few weeks for a booking link!</p> 

    <p>We recommend arriving to Rosario by Thursday, February 5th and leaving Monday, February 9, so you can enjoy all the fun activities we have planned.</p>
